{"instruction": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information, such as cookies or session tokens, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.\n\n### Example Scenario:\nImagine a simple web application with a search feature that displays the user's query on the results page without proper sanitization. For instance, if a user searches for \"laptop,\" the page might show: \"Search results for: laptop.\"\n\n### Attack Vector:\nAn attacker could craft a malicious search query containing a script. For example:\n```html\n<script>alert('XSS Attack');</script>\n```\nIf the application fails to sanitize this input, the script will execute in the browser of any user who views the search results page, displaying an alert box.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n1. **Input Submission**: The attacker submits the malicious script as the search query.\n2", "context": "Target: /vulnerabilities/xss_r/ parameter 'name'.

XSS attacks are broadly categorized into three types:\n\n1. **Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, comment field, or forum post). When other users access the affected page, the script executes automatically in their browsers.\n\n2. **Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS)**: The malicious script is embedded in a URL or input field and is immediately reflected back to the user by the web application, often as part of an error message or search result. This type typically requires the user to click a crafted link.\n\n3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code (JavaScript)\n<|assistant|>\nI'm ready to assist you with generating a precise XSS payload. Please provide the specific instruction or details about the XSS scenario you'd like me to address, such as:\n\n- The context (e.g., reflected, stored, DOM-based XSS)\n- Input constraints or filters in place\n- Desired outcome (e.g., cookie theft, defacement, alert box)\n- Any specific characters or tags that are allowed/blocked\n\nOnce you share the instruction, I'll craft a tailored payload accordingly.\n<|endoftext|>"}

XSS attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data without proper validation or escaping, allowing the data to be executed as code in the user's browser.\n\nThere are three primary types of XSS attacks:\n\n1. **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is embedded in a URL and reflected off the web server, such as in an error message or search result, without being stored permanently. For example:\n   - A vulnerable site might have a search function that echoes the user's input directly in the response. An attacker could craft a URL like:\n     ```\n     https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>\n     ```\n     If the site fails to sanitize the input,\n<|assistant|>\nI'm ready to assist with generating a precise XSS payload based on your specific instruction. Please provide the details of the XSS scenario, including any constraints, target context (e.g., HTML injection point, event handlers, or script contexts), and desired behavior (e.g., alert, cookie theft, etc.). This will help me craft an accurate and effective payload for your needs.\n<|endoftext|>"}

These scripts can steal sensitive information, such as cookies or session tokens, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites. XSS attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data without proper validation or escaping, allowing the data to be executed as code in the user's browser.\n\nThere are three primary types of XSS attacks:\n\n1. **Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, and is served to users whenever they access the affected page. For example, an attacker might post a comment on a blog that contains a script, which then runs in the browsers of all users who view that comment.\n\n2. **Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS)**: The malicious script is reflected off the web server, such as in an\n<|assistant|>\nI'm ready to assist with generating a precise XSS payload based on your specific instruction. Please provide the details of the XSS scenario, including:\n\n- Target context (e.g., HTML injection point, JavaScript context, attribute context)\n- Any filtering or sanitization measures in place\n- Desired outcome (e.g., cookie theft, defacement, alert box)\n- Browser/environment constraints if applicable\n\nOnce you provide the specific instruction, I'll craft an appropriate payload that meets your requirements while demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.\n<|endoftext|>"}
