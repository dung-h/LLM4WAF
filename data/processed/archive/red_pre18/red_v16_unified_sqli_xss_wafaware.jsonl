When a user requests the stored information, the script is executed. For example, an attacker might post a comment containing a script on a blog; whenever someone views that comment, the script runs.\n\n2. **Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS):** The malicious script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message\n<|assistant|>\nI'm ready to assist you with generating a precise XSS payload.
