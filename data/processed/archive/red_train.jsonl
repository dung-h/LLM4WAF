The goal is to infer information about the database structure by observing delays caused by the `SLEEP()` and `BENCHMARK()` functions.\n2. The `ORDER BY` clause attempts to sort the results by columns 1, 4, and also includes `SLEEP(5)` to introduce a 5-second delay and `BENCHMARK(1000000,MD5('A'))` to consume server resources. If the application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the ORDER BY clause, the database will execute these functions.\n3. The payload does not contain explicit WAF evasion techniques. However, the comma-separated list of arguments in `ORDER BY` might bypass some basic WAF filters that are looking for SQL keywords in specific contexts or patterns.\n4. If the injection is successful, the database will execute the `SLEEP(5)` function, resulting in a 5-second delay in the application's response. The `BENCHMARK` function will cause a significant CPU load on the server, also contributing to the delay and potentially resource exhaustion.\n5. This payload is effective because it exploits a common vulnerability in the `ORDER BY` clause by injecting time-delaying functions. By observing the response time, an attacker can confirm the presence of SQL injection and potentially extract information or cause a denial-of-service by overloading the server."}

The goal is to infer information about the database structure by observing delays caused by the `SLEEP()` and `BENCHMARK()` functions.\n2. The `ORDER BY` clause attempts to sort the results by columns 1, 4, and also includes `SLEEP(5)` to introduce a 5-second delay and `BENCHMARK(1000000,MD5('A'))` to consume server resources. If the application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the ORDER BY clause, the database will execute these functions.\n3. The payload does not contain explicit WAF evasion techniques. However, the comma-separated list of arguments in `ORDER BY` might bypass some basic WAF filters that are looking for SQL keywords in specific contexts or patterns.\n4. If the injection is successful, the database will execute the `SLEEP(5)` function, resulting in a 5-second delay in the application's response. The `BENCHMARK` function will cause a significant CPU load on the server, also contributing to the delay and potentially resource exhaustion.\n5. This payload is effective because it exploits a common vulnerability in the `ORDER BY` clause by injecting time-delaying functions. By observing the response time, an attacker can confirm the presence of SQL injection and potentially extract information or cause a denial-of-service by overloading the server."}
