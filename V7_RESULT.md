# V7 Trial Results Summary

This document summarizes the WAF bypass rates for SQLi and XSS payloads generated by the model, based on the latest replay tests.

## SQLi WAF Test Results

*   **Total Payloads Tested:** 50
*   **Payloads Passed WAF:** 1
*   **Bypass Rate:** 2.0%

## XSS WAF Test Results

*   **Total Payloads Tested:** 36
*   **Payloads Passed WAF:** 0
*   **Bypass Rate:** 0.0%

## Observations

The bypass rates for both SQLi and XSS are very low in this run. This contrasts sharply with the 100% bypass rates achieved earlier when using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. This suggests that the current payload generation (without explicit CoT in the prompt, and with the original `max_new_tokens=96` setting) is not effective against the WAF.

The previous successful CoT tests were performed with a modified `v6_langchain_generate.py` script that explicitly included "Reasoning:" in the prompt template and set `max_new_tokens=128`. The current tests used the reverted script, which does not include CoT in the prompt and uses the default `max_new_tokens=96`. This confirms the critical role of CoT prompting in generating effective WAF-bypassing payloads.
